/**
 * OPERATORS:
 * 
 * Roughly speaking, operators "act" on data.
 * 
 * Some familiar examples include: 
 * Assignment. Ex. var nameFirst = "Andrew"
 * 
 * Comparison: Ex. obj1.nameFirst == obj2.nameFirst
 * 
 * Arithmetic: Ex. 5 + 5
 * 
 * // Comparison Operators //
 * Comparison operators compare to operands and evaulate to boolean true or 
 * false.
 * 
 * Ex. 
 * 1 > 2
 * 1 == 2
 * a =< b
 * 1 + 2 / 5 < 3
 * and so on.......
 * 
 * // Strict Comparison //
 * As a subnote of the above section: A strict comparison is a comparison which
 * takes into account both VALUE and TYPE.  
 * 
 * equal to: ==
 * strictly equal to: ===
 * strictly not equal to: !==
 * 
 * // Unary Operators //
 * Unary operators take only ONE operand and perform an operation on them.
 * 
 * Logical not (!)
 * Increment (++)
 * Decrement (--)
 * typeof
 * 
 * 
 * // Logical Operators //
 * Logical operators are representative of logical conjunctions used in plain
 * English such as AND, OR, and NOT.
 * 
 * (&&) AND Operator: both conditions must resolve to true.
 * (||) OR Operator: at least one of a set of conditions must resolve to true.
 * (!) NOT Operator: Flips the truithiness of a value.
 * 
 * (!!) Double Bang. This is essentially two ! signs cancelling eachother out.
 * 
 * 
 * // Arithmetic Operators //
 * Relatively self-explainatory.  These operators perform arithmetic functions
 * such as addition, subtraction, division, etc.
 * 
 * Simple examples include:
 * Add (+)
 * Subtract (-)
 * Multiply (*)
 * Divide (/)
 * 
 * A couple useful arithmetic operators that exist in JavaScript but not in 
 * regular Mathematics include:
 * Increment (++) :adds 1 to the attached value
 * Decrement (--) :subtracts 1 from the attached value
 * Modulus (%) :otherwise known as "division remainder". Outputs remainder.
 * 
 * // String Operators //
 * Some unique ways in whihc strings react to certain operands:
 * 
 * The addition operator (+) can "concatenate" two strings like so:
 * Word3 = Word1 + Word 2
 * 
 * And in shorthand with the additon reassignment operator (+=):
 * Ingredient1 += Ingredient2 // => Ingredient1 = Ingredient1 + Ingredient2
 * 
 *
